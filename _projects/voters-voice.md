## Overview

Campaign finance information for candidates running for local offices is not readily accessible to the public. When the amount of money being spent as well as the source is not known, voters feel disenfranchised by the election process. We are working on a website which will show campaign contributions and expenditures for each local candidate to have better transparency for our election process.
